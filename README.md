# Overview  

Working on creating a full-stack RSVP dapp by an example from "30 days of Web3" project. Think of it as a web3-native Eventbrite, except attendees need to deposit ETH to RSVP and will get it back upon them checking in at the event.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
